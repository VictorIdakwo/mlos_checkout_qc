## Process & Procedure

### 1. Upload Your File

Use the **sidebar uploader** to upload your MLOS checkout file. The tool accepts `.sqlite`, `.db`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.xls` files.

Once uploaded, the app:
1. Runs **Auto Correct** on the MLoS data (pre-step before QC)
2. Runs all 4 QC layers on the corrected data in sequence

A **labelled progress bar** tracks each step:

| Step | Progress | Layer |
|------|----------|-------|
| Pre-step | — | 🔧 Auto Correct |
| Step 1 / 5 | 5% → 20% | 🔎 Schema Alignment |
| Step 2 / 5 | 21% → 40% | 🏘️ MLoS Rules |
| Step 3 / 5 | 41% → 60% | 📐 Settlement QC |
| Step 4 / 5 | 61% → 80% | 📍 Takeoffpoint Rules |
| Step 5 / 5 | 81% → 100% | 🗺️ Boundary Checks |

---

### 2. Auto Correct (Pre-step)

Auto Correct runs automatically **before** every QC. The corrected MLoS data is used for all 4 QC layers.

| # | Field(s) | Correction |
|---|----------|------------|
| 1 | `highrisk`, `slums`, `densely_populated`, `hard2reach`, `border`, `nomadic`, `riverine`, `fulani` | NULL → `NA` |
| 2 | `scattered` | NULL or `NA` → `N` |
| 3 | `reasons_for_inaccessibility` | NULL → `NA` where `accessibility_status` is `Fully Accessible` |
| 4 | `source` | NULL or empty → `IE` |
| 5 | `eha_guid` | All `{` `}` stripped; any still-invalid UUID replaced with a fresh generated UUID |

The **🔧 Auto Correct tab** shows the correction log and a **⬇️ Download Full MLoS — Auto Corrected (Excel)** button (always visible).

---

### 3. Schema Alignment (Rules S1–S2)

### 4. MLoS QC Checks

Data integrity rules applied to the MLoS table.

| Rule | Check | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Takeoffpoint Name Match | `takeoffpoint` must match `name` in the Takeoffpoint table |
| 3 | Takeoffpoint Code Match | `takeoffpoint_code` must match `code` in the Takeoffpoint table |
| 4 | Ward Code Match | `ward_code` must match `wardcode` in the Takeoffpoint table |
| 6 | Security Compromised Y/N | `security_compromised` must be `Y` or `N` |
| 7 | Accessibility Status Valid | Must be: `Fully Accessible`, `Partially Accessible`, or `Inaccessible` |
| 8 | Reason for Inaccessibility Required | Partially/Inaccessible settlements must have a reason |
| 9 | Habitational Status Valid | Must be: `Abandoned`, `Migrated`, `Inhabited`, or `Partially Inhabited` |
| 10 | set_target ≤ set_population | `set_target` must not exceed `set_population` |
| 11 | number_of_household ≤ set_population | `number_of_household` must not exceed `set_population` |
| 13 | Urban / Rural / Scattered Y/N | Each must be `Y` or `N`; cannot be both Urban and Rural, or Urban and Scattered |
| 14 | Profile Flags Y/N/NA | `highrisk`, `slums`, `densely_populated`, `hard2reach`, `border`, `nomadic`, `riverine`, `fulani` must be `Y`, `N`, or `NA` |
| 16 | Editor Format | `editor` must follow the format `firstname.surname` (all lowercase) |

> Rules 5 (No Null in Required Fields), 12 (Day of Activity), 14t (team_code numeric), and 15 (Source = MLoS) have been removed. Rule 5 was removed as null checks are not enforced — `primarysettlement_name`, `alternate_name`, and `reasons_for_inaccessibility` are explicitly nullable; Rule 12 was dropped as a QC requirement; Rule 14t was removed as `team_code` is a varchar field; Rule 15 is handled by Auto Correct (`source` NULL → `IE`).

---

### 5. Settlement QC Checks (Rules SQ1–SQ4)

Spatial integrity checks applied to the MLoS settlement records.

| Rule | Check | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| SQ1 | Duplicate Settlement Name in Ward | `settlement_name` must not repeat within the same `ward_code` |
| SQ2 | Latitude/Longitude — Not Null | `latitude` and `longitude` must not be null or missing |
| SQ2b | Latitude/Longitude — Not Zero | `latitude` and `longitude` must not be zero (checked only on non-null rows) |
| SQ3 | Stacked Coordinates | No two settlements may share identical `latitude`/`longitude` coordinates |
| SQ4 | Settlements Too Close (< 30 m) | Every settlement must be more than 30 metres from all other settlements (Haversine distance) |

---

### 6. Takeoffpoint QC Checks (Rules TP2–TP5)

Cross-table consistency checks between the Takeoffpoint and MLoS tables.

| Rule | Check | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| TP2 | Name matches MLoS | `name` must match `takeoffpoint` in the MLoS table |
| TP3 | Code matches MLoS | `code` must match `takeoffpoint_code` in the MLoS table |
| TP4 | Ward Code matches MLoS | `wardcode` must match `ward_code` in the MLoS table |
| TP5 | GlobalID is UUID | `globalid` must be a valid UUID |

> If a CSV file is uploaded, Takeoffpoint data is unavailable and rules TP2–TP5 are skipped with a warning.

---

### 7. Boundary Checks (Rules B0–B3)

Spatial and reference validation against the admin ward boundary dataset (9,410 wards).

| Rule | Check | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| B0 | Ward Code — Not Available on Data | `ward_code` is null or empty in the uploaded data |
| B1 | Ward Code — Boundary Reference | `ward_code` must exist in the boundary reference for the file's state(s) (only checked for rows with a non-null ward_code) |
| B2 | Coordinates — Within Ward Boundary | `latitude`/`longitude` must fall within the bounding box of the declared `ward_code` |
| B3 | State Name — Boundary Reference Match | `state_name` in MLoS must match the `state_name` the boundary reference assigns to the same `ward_code` |

**State filtering:** The boundary reference is pre-filtered by `state_name` (e.g. "Nasarawa", "Kano") matched case-insensitively against the uploaded file's `state_name` column. Fallback to the full 9,410-ward reference if no match is found.

> `state_code` is not used for filtering — the 2-letter code `"NA"` (Nasarawa) is silently converted to `NaN` by pandas when reading from SQLite, making the filter unreliable.

**Boundary Issues tab** includes reference comparison columns:

| Extra Column | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `Ref Ward Code` | Ward code as it appears in the boundary reference |
| `Ref Ward Name` | Ward name from the reference |
| `Ref LGA Code` / `Ref LGA Name` | LGA from the reference |
| `Ref State Code` | State from the reference |
| `In Boundary Reference` | `Yes` or `No — not found in reference` |

Reference files bundled in the repo:
- `ward_boundary_ref.csv` — 9,410 ward codes with state, LGA, and ward metadata
- `ward_boundary_bbox.csv` — bounding box (min/max lon/lat) per ward code

---

### 8. Weighted QC Score

After all 4 layers run, the app calculates a **Weighted QC Score** that reflects the relative importance of each layer:

| QC Layer | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| 🔎 Schema Alignment | 10% |
| 🏘️ MLoS Rules | 40% |
| 📐 Settlement QC | 20% |
| 📍 Takeoffpoint Rules | 20% |
| 🗺️ Boundary Checks | 10% |

**How it's calculated:**

For each layer, the *layer pass rate* = number of passing rules ÷ total rules in that layer. The weighted contribution = layer pass rate × layer weight × 100.

```
Weighted Score = (Schema Pass Rate × 10%) + (MLoS Pass Rate × 40%)
               + (Settlement Pass Rate × 20%) + (TP Pass Rate × 20%)
               + (Boundary Pass Rate × 10%)
```

> If a layer has no applicable checks (e.g. Takeoffpoint rules skipped for CSV uploads), that layer receives **full credit** (100% pass rate) so the score is not unfairly penalised.

The score and a breakdown table are shown in the **📊 QC Summary** tab. The 🏆 score also appears in the top metric bar on the dashboard.

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------------|
| 80% – 100% | Green — file is in good shape |
| 60% – 79% | Amber — notable issues to review |
| 0% – 59% | Red — significant data quality problems |

---

### 9. MLoS Issues — Longitudinal View

The **MLoS Issues** tab includes a longitudinal (wide-format) view of all settlement rows that failed at least one rule:

- Each row represents one settlement
- Each QC rule appears as a column (e.g. `Rule_6 | Security Compromised Y/N`)
- **Yes** = error present on that row for that rule
- **No** = no error on that rule for that row
- Click **Download MLoS Issues — Longitudinal (Excel)** to export the workbook
